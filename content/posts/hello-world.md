First post! After thinking about it for years now, I finally took the plunge, bought a domain, spent three days learning how to build a static site with Hugo, and am now writing my first post.

What really triggered me to do this was [Ali Abdaal's](https://youtu.be/vyVpRiqOvt4) video on YouTube talking about reasons to start writing online, which really resonated with me. (The title is clickbait-y but the reason is not really to make money). 

### I'm not a content creator
One of the reasons I procrastinated for so long on this is I didn't want to be in constant self-afflicted pressure of having to come up with new content. The video helped me shift my mindset towards thinking of writing not as creating content, but as a way of **documenting** or **"showing my work"**. It's merely a space for me to organise my thoughts, as I often write messy notes and incomplete drafts everywhere to document my thoughts so I can always revisit them. I'm also a fan of Amazon's practice of using **narratives** to explain your work, as it helps organise your own thought process and find gaps in your reasoning as well. So this is a way of getting better at that. I don't have to constantly think of new topics, I just have to dump what's already been on my mind in an organised manner.

This is also why I chose to write on a personal site instead of a platform like Medium where it might be easier to get traffic and viewership--I'm doing this entirely for myself.

### Inspiring one person with one idea
Every once in a while a small idea comes along that changes everything. (Yes I'm plagiarising a Steve Jobs quote). If I were to reflect upon my life, every now and then, I would casually read or hear about something that--completely unexpectedly--changed the way I live my life. It could be changing a daily habit, or planting a seed of thought that would grow to impact the way I think about many other things in life. I'd imagine that the compounded impact of these small ideas accumulated throughout the rest of my life is IMMENSE. And I think it's extremely satisfying and proud if I can impact someone positively in that way. So for whatever boring idea I write here that reaches the handful of people who will actually read it, if I can inspire just one person with one idea that changes everything, it'd have been worth it.

### Overcoming the fear of uncreativity
I've always thought of myself as someone who lacks creativity, especially when it comes to things like art and writing. I can never understand how some people write amazingly well, and I'm envious. But maybe, if I'm just documenting personal thoughts and experiences, I don't have to be creative. Maybe, writing more somehow makes me write better? Maybe, I have untapped creativity lying somewhere, waiting to be unleashed?
